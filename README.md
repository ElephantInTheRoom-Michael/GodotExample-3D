# GodotExample-3D

## Setup

This game requires a Godot editor built with .Net support.

Download 3d_squash_the_creeps_starter.zip from
https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_3d_game/index.html#doc-your-first-3d-game
and extract in the top game directory keeping the contents in the directory
3d_squash_the_creeps_starter. Delete the file
3d_squash_the_creeps_starter/project.godot so this subdirectory will 
show in the Godot editor.

Do not commit these downloaded files to this repository to avoid any license issues.
